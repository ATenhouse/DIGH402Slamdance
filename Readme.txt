"Project Machete": Navigating Sinclair's Jungle

PLEASE NOTE:
This is a largely deprecated project, created in fulfillment of a Master of Arts in Digitial Humanities at Loyola University Chicago's Center for Textual Studies and Digital Humanities. It has since been retooled and improved to better showcase skills gained as a QA Automation Engineer at Answers.com as part of a portfolio.

The project is modeled largely on a M-V-C pattern.

Attributions:
- This project was developed largely using a Zend-like '402 framework' developed by a course instructor for Digital Humanities 402 for Spring 2012.

Third-party Plugins Include:
* image_magnify.js - js for image_magnify plugin using jquery library, found at http://www.elevateweb.co.uk/image-zoom
* rwdImageMaps jQuery plugin v1.5 - Allows image maps to be used in a responsive design by recalculating the area coordinates to match the actual image size on load and window.resize. Copyright (c) 2013 Matt Stow, Licensed under the MIT license

This has been tested thoroughly on Mac OS X 10.10.4.  It displays
nearly identically on Windows, but without a normalize.css or similar, there
will be certain inconsistencies.

All assets are considered 'fair use' in good faith because:
- all extracts comrpise less than a chapter of a given
- the project was constructed as an academic project examining American history, juvenile media, and Upton Sinclair's larger reception in American
society.
